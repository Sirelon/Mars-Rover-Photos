  "funFacts": [
    "Curiosity is about the size of a small SUV, measuring 10 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 7 feet tall, and it weighs 1,982 pounds (899 kg)",
    "The rover has 17 cameras, including color cameras capable of taking HD video at 10 frames per second",
    "It carries a laser called ChemCam that can vaporize rocks from up to 23 feet away, firing over 14 million laser shots since landing",
    "Curiosity has its own built-in chemistry lab called SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) that can detect organic molecules",
    "The rover generates its own power using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator that produces 110 watts, rather than solar panels, allowing it to work at night and through dust storms",
    "It has driven over 20 miles (32 km) on Mars since landing in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012",
    "The rover's wheels are made of aluminum and have a built-in Morse code pattern that spells 'JPL' in the tracks it leaves behind",
    "Curiosity can climb slopes up to 45 degrees and cross obstacles up to 75 cm high",
    "The rover once sang 'Happy Birthday' to itself on Mars on August 5, 2013, using its sample analysis vibrations to create musical tones",
    "Landing Curiosity required a complex 'sky crane' maneuver, the first time this technique was used on Mars",
    "The rover discovered that ancient Mars had the right chemistry to support microbial life, including water, key chemical ingredients, and energy sources",
    "Curiosity found evidence that lakes and streams existed on Mars for millions of years, not just brief periods",
    "The mission cost approximately $2.5 billion, making it one of the most expensive Mars missions",
    "Curiosity's top speed is 0.09 mph (0.14 km/h), but autonomous navigation helps it avoid hazards",
    "The rover carries a small piece of metal from the World Trade Center, recovered after the 9/11 attacks",
    "Its robotic arm is 7 feet (2.1 meters) long and weighs 66 pounds (30 kg)",
    "Curiosity can analyze rock and soil samples with its onboard X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectrometers",
    "The rover detected methane spikes in the Martian atmosphere, which could indicate geological or biological activity",
    "Curiosity's computers are radiation-hardened PowerPC processors running at 200 MHz with 256 MB of RAM, less powerful than a smartphone",
    "The rover uses its wheels as seismometers, detecting vibrations as it drives across different terrain"
