    "Search for and characterize rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars",
    "Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing site",
    "Determine what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain",
    "Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by instruments on Mars orbiters",
    "Search for iron-containing minerals that formed in water",
    "Characterize the mineralogy and textures of rocks and soils"

  "funFacts": [
    "Spirit operated for over 6 years (2,208 sols) from January 2004 to March 2010, far exceeding its 90-day mission design",
    "The rover discovered evidence that ancient Mars was wet and possibly habitable, including silica-rich soil and sulfate deposits",
    "It climbed Husband Hill (named after Columbia commander Rick Husband), which rises about 300 feet (90 meters) above the Gusev Crater floor",
    "Spirit got stuck in soft soil called 'Troy' on May 1, 2009, and operated as a stationary science platform for nearly a year",
    "The rover survived temperatures as low as -148°F (-100°C) at night during Martian winter",
    "Spirit took over 124,550 images during its mission, including spectacular panoramas from hilltops",
    "It traveled a total distance of 4.8 miles (7.73 km) on Mars before getting permanently stuck",
    "The rover discovered nearly pure silica deposits (90% pure) suggesting past hot springs, geysers, or steam vents - prime locations for ancient microbial life",
    "Spirit's twin rover, Opportunity, landed on the opposite side of Mars three weeks later on January 25, 2004",
    "NASA's last communication with Spirit was on March 22, 2010, after it failed to survive its fourth Martian winter",
    "Spirit weighed 384 pounds (174 kg) on Earth, identical to its twin Opportunity",
    "The rover was powered by solar panels that initially generated about 140 watts, but dust accumulation reduced power over time",
    "Spirit landed in Gusev Crater, chosen because it appeared to be an ancient lake bed, though the landing site turned out to be covered in volcanic rock",
    "The rover's right front wheel stopped working in 2006, forcing it to drive backwards while dragging the broken wheel, which accidentally uncovered bright white silica soil",
    "Spirit discovered evidence of past explosive volcanic eruptions by analyzing rocks in the Columbia Hills",
    "The rover found carbonates, minerals that form in the presence of water and could preserve signs of past life",
    "Spirit experienced several close calls, including nearly being blown over by dust devils and getting stuck on earlier occasions before the final Troy incident",
    "The mission cost approximately $400 million for the rover, with additional yearly operational costs",
    "Spirit's computer was a 20 MHz RAD6000 processor with 128 MB of RAM and 256 MB of flash memory",
    "The rover was declared dead on May 25, 2011, after more than a year of no communication"
