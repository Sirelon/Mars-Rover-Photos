  "objectives": [
    "Study the deep interior structure of Mars to understand terrestrial planet formation",
    "Measure the planet's seismic activity (marsquakes) and meteorite impacts",
    "Determine the rate of heat flow from Mars' interior",
    "Measure the size, thickness, density, and overall structure of Mars' core, mantle, and crust",
    "Determine the current state of Mars' tectonic activity and impact cratering rate",
    "Investigate how rocky planets differentiate and evolve"

  "funFacts": [
    "InSight is a stationary lander, not a rover, so it doesn't move around Mars and stays in one location in Elysium Planitia",
    "It successfully deployed the SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure), the first seismometer on Mars since Viking missions in the 1970s",
    "The lander recorded over 1,319 marsquakes during its mission, with the largest being magnitude 5.0",
    "InSight's heat probe (HP³ or 'the mole') was designed to dig 16 feet (5 meters) deep but it only reached about 14 inches due to unexpected soil properties",
    "It has two large circular solar panels that span about 20 feet (6 meters) when fully deployed, generating up to 700 watts on Mars",
    "The mission operated from November 26, 2018, to December 21, 2022, when accumulated dust on solar panels reduced power below operational levels",
    "InSight detected meteor impacts on Mars and located their craters using seismic data, the first time seismic waves and impacts have been linked on another planet",
    "The lander confirmed that Mars' core is liquid (molten) and larger than previously thought, with a radius of about 1,137 miles (1,830 km)",
    "Its seismometer is so sensitive that it can detect ground movements smaller than the width of a hydrogen atom and can measure vibrations at frequencies from 0.01 to 50 Hz",
    "Over 2.4 million names were sent to Mars on two silicon microchips aboard InSight",
    "InSight landed using a heat shield and parachute system similar to the Phoenix lander, touching down at about 5 mph (8 km/h)",
    "The lander weighs 794 pounds (360 kg) on Earth and about 300 pounds (136 kg) on Mars",
    "InSight detected over 21 confirmed meteorite impacts on Mars, with some creating craters up to 490 feet (150 meters) wide",
    "The mission discovered that Mars' crust is thinner than expected under the landing site, about 12 to 23 miles (20-37 km) thick",
    "InSight's robotic arm is 7.8 feet (2.4 meters) long and was used to place instruments on the surface",
    "The lander detected seasonal variations in seismic activity, with fewer quakes detected during dusty, windy seasons",
    "InSight cost approximately $830 million, including spacecraft development, launch, and operations",
    "The seismometer was protected by a dome-shaped Wind and Thermal Shield to minimize environmental interference",
    "InSight's data revealed that Mars experiences frequent small quakes, similar to tectonic activity on Earth but caused by cooling and contraction",
    "The mission's final communication was on December 15, 2022, after four years of groundbreaking planetary science"
