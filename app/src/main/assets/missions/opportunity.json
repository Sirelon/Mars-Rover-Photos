  "funFacts": [
    "Originally designed for a 90-day mission, Opportunity operated for almost 15 years (5,352 sols or 5,498 Earth days) from 2004 to 2018",
    "The rover traveled 28.06 miles (45.16 km), holding the off-Earth roving distance record until 2024",
    "It discovered strong evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, including rocks formed in water and mineral deposits left by evaporating water",
    "Opportunity survived multiple Martian dust storms before the final planet-encircling storm in June 2018 blocked sunlight to its solar panels",
    "The rover's final transmission on June 10, 2018, indicated critically low power, and its last message was interpreted as 'My battery is low and it's getting dark'",
    "It took over 217,594 images during its mission, including numerous panoramas",
    "The rover was named by Sofi Collis, a 9-year-old Russian-American girl, in a NASA essay contest",
    "Opportunity discovered small spherical hematite concretions nicknamed 'blueberries' that formed in water billions of years ago",
    "The rover operated through five brutal Martian winters, surviving temperatures as low as -148°F (-100°C) at night",
    "Opportunity weighed 384 pounds (174 kg) on Earth and about 145 pounds (66 kg) on Mars",
    "It was powered entirely by solar panels, generating about 140 watts at the start of the mission",
    "The rover landed in Meridiani Planum using airbags, bouncing more than 26 times before coming to rest",
    "Opportunity's twin, Spirit, landed on the opposite side of Mars three weeks earlier",
    "The rover discovered clay minerals that form in neutral, watery conditions - evidence of potentially habitable ancient environments",
    "It climbed out of Victoria Crater after spending nearly two years exploring its interior",
    "Opportunity found evidence of ancient hot springs or steam vents through the discovery of gypsum veins",
    "The mission cost approximately $400 million for the rover, plus about $20 million per year for operations",
    "The rover's computer was a 20 MHz RAD6000 processor with 128 MB of RAM and 256 MB of flash storage",
    "Opportunity experienced occasional 'senior moments' as flash memory degraded, requiring periodic reformatting",
    "NASA made over 1,000 attempts to contact Opportunity after the 2018 dust storm before declaring the mission complete in February 2019"
