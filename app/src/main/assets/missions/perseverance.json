  "funFacts": [
    "Perseverance carried the first helicopter to fly on another planet - Ingenuity, which has flown over 70 times, far exceeding its 5-flight mission",
    "The rover is equipped with 23 cameras, more than any previous Mars mission, including 7 science cameras and 9 engineering cameras",
    "It has a device called MOXIE (Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment) that successfully produced oxygen from Mars' CO2 atmosphere multiple times, paving the way for future human missions",
    "Perseverance is collecting samples in 43 titanium tubes that will be cached for a future Mars Sample Return mission planned for the 2030s",
    "The rover landed on February 18, 2021, using a 'sky crane' maneuver with the help of a new terrain-relative navigation system",
    "It carries a piece of Martian meteorite that fell to Earth as a calibration target for its SHERLOC instrument",
    "Over 10.9 million names were etched onto three silicon microchips carried by Perseverance",
    "The rover has a robotic arm that's 7 feet (2.1 meters) long and can drill into rocks to collect core samples",
    "Perseverance recorded the first sounds ever captured on Mars using two microphones, including the sound of the Ingenuity helicopter flying",
    "It landed in Jezero Crater, a 28-mile-wide ancient lake bed that existed 3.5 billion years ago and may preserve signs of ancient life",
    "The rover can drive autonomously to avoid hazards using its advanced AutoNav AI system, covering up to 393 feet (120 meters) per day",
    "Perseverance weighs 2,260 pounds (1,025 kg), slightly heavier than Curiosity",
    "Its SuperCam instrument can analyze rocks and soil from up to 20 feet away using laser spectroscopy, camera imaging, and sound recording",
    "The rover's wheels are slightly larger and more robust than Curiosity's, with thicker aluminum and new treads to prevent damage",
    "Perseverance carries a radiation detector to help understand the radiation environment for future astronauts",
    "The rover discovered organic molecules in multiple rock samples, though this doesn't confirm past life",
    "It found rocks in Jezero Crater that have been altered by water multiple times, indicating a complex history",
    "The mission cost approximately $2.7 billion, including development, launch, and operations",
    "Perseverance's computers are RAD750 processors running at 200 MHz with 2 GB of flash memory and 256 MB of RAM",
    "The rover can communicate with Earth at up to 2 Mbps during favorable orbital alignments via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter"
